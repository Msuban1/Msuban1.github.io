# 📊 Ongoing Data Analysis Project – Week 1 Complete

This repository documents my hands-on journey through a 4 week data analytics project, designed to simulate real-world workflows and strengthen core analytical skills using Python, SQL, and storytelling techniques.

## ✅ Week 1: Data Foundations
In Week 1, I focused on the foundational stages of the data analysis process:

### 🔍 Data Collection
- Imported and explored a raw dataset using `pandas`
- Reviewed key columns, data types, and structure

### 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values and duplicates
- Cleaned column names and standardised formatting
- Converted data types (e.g., dates, numerical fields)

### 📊 Data Exploration
- Performed descriptive analysis using `pandas`
- Checked distributions and identified outliers
- Explored patterns in quantity, price, and total sales

### 📈 Data Visualisation
- Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to plot:
  - Sales trends over time
  - Product and category performance
  - Regional insights and customer behaviour
- Created a heatmap to explore correlations

### 🧠 Reporting Insights
- Documented key insights using markdown
- Summarised trends, seasonal patterns, and initial business recommendations

## 🗓️ What's Next?
As the project continues, I’ll be building on this foundation. 
This is an evolving project. In the coming weeks, I plan to explore more advanced analysis techniques, potentially incorporating:
- SQL querying
- Deeper data storytelling
- Further Python-based transformations and visualisations
- Reflection on insights, limitations, and business value

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **SQL** (via Google BigQuery / SQL Notebooks)
- **Google Colab** / Jupyter Notebook
- **Data storytelling** using markdown, reports, and visuals

This project is a personal learning initiative and will be updated weekly. Thank you for following along as I grow in data analytics!
